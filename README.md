# exoplanet-refraction

Code behind [this paper](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/01/aa31484-17/aa31484-17.html) published in Astronomy & Astrophysics in 2018.  This project was started during a summer internship at Cambridge in 2016, during which much of the coding was done. 

We investigated models of how light from the host stars of exoplanets are bent and focused by the atmospheres of the exoplanets. These predictions were then compared with data from the Kepler space telescope.
